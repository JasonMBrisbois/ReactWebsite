# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Description
This website shows pictures of 2 different dog breeds.  The user can rate the pictures by clicking on the upvote or downvote button. Once the picture is rated, a new picture will be shown. The overall rating for both breeds will be shown between the buttons.  It will also play a note increasing for upvotes and decresing for downvote.

## Architecture 

### components!

### Rating Component
This component tracks the rating.  There will be two of these components in the project, one to track each breed ratings.  The component will contain 2 buttons, one will increase the counter and one that will decrease the counter.  The counter will be between the two buttons showing what the current rating is.

### Picture Component
This is a sub component of the rating component. This component will display to the user the pictures of the dogs to be rated, and will show a new picture once the old picture is rated.  There will be 2 in the project.  This component will be notified when one of the buttons is clicked.  It will then call the api, inputing the breed type. It will then take the recived URL from the api and display the image to the user.

### Sound Component
This is a sub component of the rating component. This component will play music when the user presses one of the buttons.  It will play a different instrument for each breed.  It will play a higher note when the upvote is clicked, and a lower note if the downvote button is clicked.  It will take in the prior note as input, increase or decrease it depending on which button was clicked, and play that sound, updating the prior note to the current note.
